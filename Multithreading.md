## 📌 Key Terms

- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Permanent storage, holds all your files and programs.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary fast memory where programs are loaded for execution.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The "brain" of the computer that runs instructions.
- **Process**: A program that is currently loaded in memory and actively running.

---

✅ When a program is in HDD, it’s just stored.
✅ When it’s loaded into RAM and run by the CPU, it becomes a **process**.

---

> 💡 Modern operating systems handle this process for every app you run!

# 🧠 Multitasking with a Single-Threaded CPU and a Multitasking OS

## 🚩 Understanding the Setup

You have:

- ✅ **Multitasking Operating System** (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS)
- ✅ **1 CPU core**
- ✅ **Single-threaded CPU** (only one instruction can run at a time)
- ❓ Still want to run **multiple programs at once**

---

## ❓ How Is Multitasking Possible Then?

This is the magic of **time-sharing**.

### ✅ The OS *pretends* to run multiple programs at the same time  
It does this by **quickly switching** between them — so fast, the user doesn’t notice!

> This technique is called:
>
> ⏱️ **Time-Slicing** or **Context Switching**

---

## 🧠 Scenario: Single-Core, Single-Threaded CPU + Multitasking OS

Let's say the user opens:

- 🧾 **Program A**: Chrome
- 🧾 **Program B**: VS Code
- 🧾 **Program C**: Notepad

Even though there’s only **1 CPU**, the multitasking OS handles this like so:

### 🔁 Steps:
1. Load all 3 programs into **RAM**
2. Run **Program A** for `20ms`
3. Save Program A’s **context/state**
4. Switch to **Program B** for `20ms`
5. Save Program B’s context
6. Switch to **Program C**
7. Repeat the loop rapidly...

To the user, it **feels like all programs are running at once!**

## ⚙️ Time-Slice Visualization

```text
Time(ms):  0      20     40     60     80     100
           |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
CPU runs:   A       B       C       A       B
...
```

# 🧠 Multitasking vs Multithreading in a Multitasking Operating System

Understanding the difference between **multitasking** and **multithreading**, and how they operate at different levels:

---

## 🎛️ 1. Multitasking — Handled by the OS Scheduler

### ✅ Definition:
**Multitasking** means running **multiple programs** seemingly at the same time.

### 👨‍💻 Example:
- Chrome is open
- Spotify is playing music
- VS Code is editing code

All are running at once — even if you only have **1 CPU**.

### ⚙️ How It Works:
- The **Operating System Scheduler** (part of the kernel) handles multitasking.
- It assigns **time slices** to each process.
- Each program gets a turn on the CPU, rapidly switching between them.

### 📍 Level:
- Happens at the **OS/system level**
- You, the programmer, don’t control this
- Managed by OS automatically

---

## 🧵 2. Multithreading — Handled by the Programmer (or Runtime)

### ✅ Definition:
**Multithreading** means running **multiple threads** within a **single program**.

### 👨‍💻 Example:
In a game:
- Thread 1: Handles input
- Thread 2: Handles graphics
- Thread 3: Handles music

Or in a web server:
- Each client gets a thread to handle the request

### ⚙️ How It Works:
- The **programmer** writes multithreaded code
- Or the **language runtime** (like JVM, Node.js, Python) does it
- The OS then schedules those threads

### 📍 Level:
- Happens at the **application/program level**
- Controlled by **you**, the developer
- But depends on the OS scheduler **under the hood**

---

## 🔄 Combined Operation Example

Suppose you open two apps:

- 🧾 Program A: Chrome (with 20 tabs)
- 🧾 Program B: VS Code

And Program A uses multiple threads:
- Tab 1 runs in Thread 1
- Tab 2 in Thread 2
- Rendering engine in Thread 3

The OS is:
- Doing **multitasking** between Chrome and VS Code
- Doing **multithreading** *inside* Chrome (with help from the app)

## 🧠 Final Key Differences

| Feature              | Multitasking                            | Multithreading                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Level                | OS-level                                 | Program-level                               |
| Who controls it?     | OS Scheduler                             | Programmer or language runtime              |
| What runs?           | Multiple **programs/processes**          | Multiple **threads inside one process**     |
| Use case             | Running apps side-by-side                | Doing many things in one app efficiently    |
| Example              | Chrome + VS Code running together        | Chrome has threads for each tab             |

## 📌 In Simple Words

> 🧠 **Multitasking** = OS runs many programs  
> 🧵 **Multithreading** = Programmer makes one program do many things at once  

Both work **together** in modern systems — multitasking makes your system powerful, multithreading makes your **apps** powerful!
